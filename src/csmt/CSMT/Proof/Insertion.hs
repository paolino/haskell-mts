--
-- This module provides functionality for generating and verifying Merkle
-- inclusion proofs. An inclusion proof demonstrates that a specific value
-- exists in the tree and contributes to the root hash.
--
-- A proof consists of a sequence of sibling hashes along the path from
-- the target value to the root, allowing verification without access to
-- the full tree.
